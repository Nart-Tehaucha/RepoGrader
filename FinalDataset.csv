I am building a web server that supports a local browser-based app. I
do not want that web server to be accessible to other devices on the
network (e.g. other people at a coffeeshop). So, as a start, I’d like
to specify the hostname that the wasabi HTTPServer binds to be
127.0.0.1 instead of the default wildcard (0.0.0.0).

I am leaving the default hostname as null, which uses the previous
behavior. I believe this is consistent with NodeJS’s defaults, so I
don’t have motivation to change the defaults (athough, it would be more
conservative to not assume the user wants their in-development web
server to be accessible to other devices on the network).

I did however change the AppServer used during tests to use 127.0.0.1
instead of 0.0.0.0. Since tests are run locally, this change didn’t
require any other changes. Hypothetically, this would prevent tests
randomly being influenced by some unexpected traffic on your network
(again e.g., someone port scanning at a coffee shop).

Unfortunately, I could not think of a way to test the negative - that
servers are inaccessible from outside of localhost. I did test this
manually in my real-world app, though."

`text || regclass`, via the `regclass` to `text` cast, already quotes table identifiers where necessary. The `quote_ident` calls here are unnecessary, and in fact incorrect as they result in quotes that were part of the table quoting becoming part of the identifier name.

```
create table ""I will
hack your');DROP TABLE student;--"" (
haha integer
);

SELECT '""I will
hack your'');DROP TABLE student;--""'::regclass::oid;

 hack your');DROP TABLE student;--""

autovala,15,783,670,1453,"Added support for specifying a tag for xgettext to filter notes for translators

xgettext has support for converting a comment before a translatable string in a
note for translators. In order to do this it is a must to add the '--add-comments'
parameter to xgettext. Also it si possible to add a tag in order to filter the
comments based on the first word, thus allowing to separate ""ordinary"" comments
and ""notes for translators"" comments.

These changes allow to include this capability in autovala, so now running
'autovala po' will also add the notes for translators."

Due to a mistake, the package dependency optimizations for debian added in 1.4.0 didn't work in non-english systems. This has been fixed.

Also, now instead of taking a ""control.base"" file to use it as a template for the
new ""control"" file in debian package, it takes the current ""control"" file, so the
changes made to it will be kept. This means that, if you want to change the
description, you just have to edit the current ""control"" file in the ""debian"" folder

sawfish,26,27,14,41,"match-window: allow specifying arbitrary functions as filter

Extend the ‘match-window-profile’ syntax such that specifying ‘(cons
FUNC ARGS)’ as a filter calls ‘(FUNC WND . ARGS)’ to filter windows
and profiles based on criteria different than just window properties.

For example, the following rule applies actions only to the first
terminal window:

    (define (my-first-terminal-p wnd)
      (let ((is-term (lambda (wnd)
                       (let ((cls (get-x-text-property wnd 'WM_CLASS)))

        (and (is-term wnd)
             (do ((wnds (managed-windows) (cdr wnds)))
                 ((or (null wnds)
                      (and (not (eq (car wnds) wnd))
                           (is-term (car wnds))))

sawfish,26,54,29,83,"shrink-yank: recognise screen edges when shrinking or yanking windows

If a window crosses two displays neither ‘shrink-window’ nor
‘yank-window’ recognises the edge between screens as an intersection.
This is in contrast to ‘pack-window’ and ‘grow-window’ which recognise
screen edges as boundaries to recognise.

Change ‘find-least-intersection’ to consider edges of the screens

shrink or yank against."

To make versioning simpler I simply set this version to 3.2 to mark
that it is compatible with MSL 3.2 and follow the same track as for
example ModelicaServices.

In order to include this library into the MSL we should follow a proper
process which is:
 1. Add the library under the name `Modelica_EnergyStorages` on
    https://modelica/libraries
 2. If the library contains enough test coverage and documentation
    the MA can vote again on its inclusion to the MSL

bakkabot,1,37,30,67,"ascii: allow figures to be mixed

Allow the printing of figures to mix figures from all categories. This
is achieved by:

- Split the print procedure in a build and a print procedure. The build
  proc builds the chain of figures to print and the print proc prints
  it.
- Have the new print proc ignore lines that only contains spaces. This
  is needed so that we can align figures against each other but drop the
  blank lines if a smaller figure is printed on its own.

  together with the alien."

CLIP,11,865,92,957,"Red Hat uses MCS constraints for svirt separation and the upstream policy
reflects that goal. Very few domains are actually confined by MCS
constraints and many object classes aren't even in the mcs file.

CLIP users are using MCS to separate domains between unique filter pipelines.
It is common to have processes in different piplines run in the same domain
but with have unique category sets. These processes should not be able to
have any information flow between them. Along with this, the CLIP use case
typically allows a domain to read down to read the common libraries and other
system configuration files. This is basically what the MLS policy already does.

This patch set copies over the relevant portions of the mls constraints file
to the mcs constraints file. It modifies the appropriate modules to ensure
that domains are running with the correct level and clearance. Most of that
is really just finding the init_ranged_daemon_domain() calls that were only
for MLS. It modifies the sid for the kernel and the loopback interface so that
they are properly ranged. The last thing this patch set does is modify the
macros used for MCS to allow them to be more flexible and allow us to start
MCS processes at system low, s0, and have them be ranged.

forth-cpu,21,316,193,509,"111.949MHz/1A86 Improved meta-compiler in embed/* The meta-compiled system in 'embed/' has been much improved, it isnearly ready to replace the current cross-compiler, which is great as itis much closer to a self-hosted system.* Size of the system for 'embed.hex' is '19AC', which offers nearly thesame functionality - it is missing a few test functions and features,but adds its own (it includes an 'editor')."
forth-cpu,21,119,173,292,"111.949MHz/1A86: Formatting, moved FIFO, I/OThe I/O primitives available to the programmer have changed. They reallyshould be put in a system vocabulary, to separate them out from standardForth words.There have been some minor formatting changes in the VHDL. There are noproject warnings in the xst synthesis log, however there are 24 INFOmessages.The UART FIFO selection code has been moved from 'top.vhd' into'uart.vhd'. The FIFO is still buggy."
forth-cpu,21,117,49,166,"109.359MHz/1AE2: VT100 bug fixes, BEL, scroll back* A primitive and not very good scroll back mechanism has been added tothe VT100 terminal emulator* Blinking has changed so only the foreground text blinks* The BEL character has been implemented (it flashes the entire screenfor just under a second).* The bugs in the VT100 caused by it not signalling it is busy have beenfixed.* Some more comments have been added."
forth-cpu,21,217,66,283,"109.636MHz/1B00: Many minor improvements* Initial UART settings can be set by a generic.* UART RX now only starts when there is a transition from high to low,there are still problems (a frame error does not propagate to the restof the system, or is not detected), but this means when the UART line isdriven low then we do not get a series of invalid characters.* The simulator now simulates the scrolling behavior of the VT100, alongwith some more of the SGR codes the hardware supports.* Some warnings have been fixed.* The 'turn of reverse video' SGR has been fixed, it was $27 when itshould have been decimal 27, or $1B.* We now erase three rows of text ahead of moving the base pointer text,this prevents errant text from previous lines being displayed.* An aid for test vector generation for the VT100 has been added, whichis a small GForth program that can be used to generate text with lots ofANSI escape sequences in it.NOTES:Many of the more serious bugs in the VT100 have been fixed, howeverthere are still differences in how the simulator behaves, and how theterminal emulators on my computer behave, which will need to be fixed.Some of the bugs include:* The AT-XY command does not seem to work after issue an erase displaycommand to the VT100, this likely due to the VT100 being too busy torespond. This only appears when the UART FIFO is enabled, or when UARToutput is disable (output only going to the VT100). This means it isgiving commands to the VT100 much quicker.* The UART FIFO RX seems to work fine, although there are the sameproblems with RX as there are without the FIFO (that is, we receiveinvalid characters with high data rates). For the TX however, acharacter seems to get stuck in the FIFO, it comes out, but then thenext character gets stuck, and so on. No data seems to be lost, but itis annoying.* There are some other VT100 differences between the hardware and how itshould behave, the test suite should help categorize and find theissues.* Other worrying things include the fact that the board seems to needreprogramming multiple times before the system gets into a stable state.Once in that stable state is appears to be very steady and stable, butit can require multiple times before it becomes stable. Symptoms includenot booting, '? -4 stack underflow' being printed, only 'eForth V' beingprinted, or reading from flash failing. I am not sure if the problem iswith my design, however reprogramming seems to fix the issue when itdoes occur, with no other design changes needed."
forth-cpu,21,25,12,37,"103.556MHz/1AFE: Basic VT100 scrollingInstead of blanking the screen after reaching the end of the screen,basic scrolling has been added. There are some minor bugs, for examplenot all of the characters are always cleared as the screen moves up.Scrolling back up could be implemented; you could only go as far back asthe base pointer will allow.There are also more warnings and 'INFO' statements in the generatedreports, which are always annoying, these should be removed beforemerging this branch into master."
forth-cpu,21,651,356,1007,"103.556MHz/1B00: Moved font, ++ VT100, test codeThe VT100 terminal emulator has been much improved, and a new attributecan be applied to the text (whilst not losing any current attributes).Text can be blinked on and off (using a clock derived from the cursorblink clock, divided by four), the cursor save and restore command hasbeen added, along with a few other miscellaneous commands, and a bug inthe relative cursor positioning routines has been fixed (a relativemove of 0 should be treated the same as 1 for those functions, it wasnot being treated that way).* UART baud initial value can be set by a generic, which is nice tohave, but not needed as it can be set from a control register. The otheroptions cannot be set at the moment and default to 8 bits, 1 stop bit,no parity.* Special cases for majority logic gates of 1, 2 and 3 have been addedto the 'majority' module.* The font directory has moved.* 'vga.vhd' converted to a UTF-8 file, fixed some invalid characters.* Formatting changed 'port(' -> 'port ('* Added extra VT100 terminal codes to simulator.* Instead of commenting out code, generate functions are used.  * This applies to the new VGA code.  * And to adding a FIFO to the UART (which almost works).* Some extra comments have been added.The next major problems with the project will be:* Making the UART more reliable, currently we get nonsense if we are notprocessing received characters quick enough and we spend a lot of timewaiting around for transmission. There is a rate that we will not beable to keep up with when it comes to processing text, however we shouldnever be receiving invalid data, which we are, if we cannot keep up.* The UART RX module does not work with certain values for the baudgenerator (specifically at 115200, the value that needs to go into theclock register is '54', however it does not work when given that value,50-53 and 55 have been tried and work, 54 does not). For TX, '54' works.* Scrolling should be handled by the VT100 terminal, currently it justerases everything on the screen. This is not optimal."

Now, consider how this impacts the tokenizer, whosepattern ends with `|.`, which should lead to replacing eachyet-unmatched input character:```Input JSON(*)      Tokens[a]                [, a, ][ab]               [, a, b, ][a`<e5>`]          [, a`<e5>`, ]```The last line is a problem, because, before this commit, `parse_value()`assumed that any token corresponding to yet-unmatched input has length 1.Consequently, the parser recognized a`<e5>` as a <value> token.To fix this case, we add `is_value()` to explicitly test that theunmatched input token is indeed a well-formed <value> token.(**)(*) The last line is test case `n_array_a_invalid_utf8.json` of the[JSONTestSuite](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite.git)In an ideal language, the parser shouldn't need to test that tokens arewell-formed -- that's the tokenizer's concern.(**) Ideally, the parser shouldn't be concerned with a token's form,which should be validated by the tokenizer exclusively. However, thetokenizer is constrained by awk's regex engine implementation."

aule,0,3286,9945,13231,"Use webpack instead of RequireJSThis is a major refactoring driven primarily by moving from RequireJS towebpack. Advantages include:- Pre-bundled scripts, templates, and stylesheets drastically improve  performance for the user.- Easier use of NPM packages.- No more Git submodules and vendor copies.- Awesome webpack dev server for development.- Ability to run coffeelint automatically during development.This refactoring touches almost all of the project and includes thefollowing changes:- Rewrite AMD to CommonJS.- Config is now found in the `AULE_CONFIG` global.- Update all dependencies to their latest version (except Bootstrap).- Use local copy of Open Sans instead of Google Fonts API.- Use URI.js for URI manipulation.- No more hardcoded assumptions on the base URI of Aulë.- Reindented all CoffeeScript to 2 spaces.- Subpage templates are no longer in separate files, but defined as  inline partials in their parent files. This is a workaround for this  bug: https://github.com/altano/handlebars-loader/issues/81And probably some smaller changes which I'm forgetting now."

Null and 'system' are treated as the same. 'dark' and 'light'will ignore OS settings.This also introduces reactivity from the OS's changing`prefers-color-scheme`, for example if your system is set to go intodark mode at sunrise, then the browser will switch to`prefers-color-scheme: dark`.

ld-decode,37,1178,3341,4519,"Replace JsonWax with an event-based parser.Previously LdDecodeMetaData stored the metadata internally usingJsonWax's tree representation, which is very inefficient -- it doesn'tknow the types of any of the data -- and made both parsing and doingoperations on it very expensive.The TBC library now includes JsonReader and JsonWriter, which provide avery simple event-based JSON parser. (It doesn't handle \u escapesbecause that means doing gymnastics with UTF-8 encoding, but given howlittle ld-decode uses strings this is probably not a problem for now.)LdDecodeMetaData now reads data directly into the structures that thetools use. In particular, there is now a vector of Field objects whichare returned by const reference, rather than having it laboriouslyconstruct a Field from the JSON data every time it's requested.The only downside of this is that LdDecodeMetaData can no longerpreserve members in JSON objects that it doesn't know about.For a typical CLV disc, testmetadata now takes 1.1s rather than 7.1s."

FunctionalCollections.jl,35,20,2,22,"Make `PersistentSet{T} <: AbstractSet{T}` (#65)* Fix bug in pvec `pop` resulting in empty tailWhen calling `pop` on a persistent vector with, eg., 33 elements, we have a `tail` of length 1.  After this `pop` call, there was a bug where the resulting pvec had a tail of length `0` rather than a tail of length `32`.  This causes errors, for instance when calling `iterate`, which expects a nonempty tail.  This PR fixes the behavior by adding a branch in `pop` function for when the tail length is currently `1` (in which case we make the new tail be `pop(trie)`).* Update PersistentVectorTest.jl* Update PersistentVector.jl* Update PersistentVectorTest.jl* make PersistentSet{T} <: AbstractSet{T}"

Rocket-Launcher,1,3678,1590,5268,"rewrote most of the applications backend, complete change in application structure
Rocket-Launcher now consists of two parts: the binary which the user executes
(which talks to D-Bus if another instance of it is running) and a shared library,
which handles most of the backend.

Some functions which were performed by GTK before (like finding the correct path
for an icon) have outsourced to the shared library.
This will make it easier to port Rocket-Launcher to another gui toolkit.

As a consequence of splitting Rocket-Launcher in two parts the separation
of backend and frontend has been enhanced.

Rocket-Launcher now support incremental builds and multithreaded builds.
To do this Rocket-Launcher uses recursive make
(I know, I know, but the depth is only one level)

- Even when the code detected that a string needed quoting, "", \n, and \r were left alone inside the double quotes, which is illegal. Replace them with appropriately escaped versions.

We also add a test that pydot is correctly able to quote Python's ""string.printable"" string, which exercises both of the above cases."

pydot-py3,0,2200,1515,3715,"Commiting pydot 1.0.2

-The parser has been improved a lot. It passes all of GraphViz's regression tests (which I consider quite an accomplishment seeing the kind of crazy constructs on those )
-Different charsets should now be dealt with properly.
-The search of GraphViz's executables has been improved for all platforms. On Windows, paths and registry keys are searched. On Unix now it should exhibit the same behavior as the traditional shell path search. (Thanks Andy Gimblett and many others)
-Double-quoted paths in Windows are nor properly handled. The os.path.exists() check fails if a valid path is enclosed within quotes.
-'type' keyword has been changed everywhere to 'graph_type'
-Better handling of Node/Edge/Graph defaults. Added methods: set_graph_defaults, set_node_defaults, set_edge_defaults, get_graph_defaults, get_node_defaults, get_edge_defaults
-Now it's possible to use rank to lay out nodes at the same level

    graph = pydot.Dot('graphname', graph_type='digraph')
    subg = pydot.Subgraph('', rank='same')
    subg.add_node(pydot.Node('a'))
    graph.add_subgraph(subg)
    subg.add_node(pydot.Node('b'))
    subg.add_node(pydot.Node('c'))

-Multiple main graphs in a file are now supported, will be returned as a list of graph instances
-Handling of shapefiles Dot().set_shape_files()
-Added method ""add_style()"" to the Node class to easily append styles to a node
-Attribute lists updated to reflect the available ones in graphviz 2.16
-Added error reporting when rendering graphs with GraphViz executables. There was an often reported problem where the output graphs would have 0 size. In most cases this was due to Graphviz missing a library for a format that pydot assumed to be there. Now the error given by the executable will be reported instead of being silently ignored (Thanks Jarno)
-Improved parsing of identifiers
-Added non-GraphViz attributes needed by dot2tex
-Jose Fonseca contributed a fix dealing with quoted strings the the dot parsing module
-setup.py updated so that it's possible to install pydot through Setuptools' easy_install
-Edge()'s can be created passing two Node objects as well as, the previously supported, two strings with node names. Warning: when passing two Node instances, the attributes won't be taken into account. The edge will only read the Nodes' names to create an edge, the Nodes must be separately added to the graph so all their attributes are ""remembered"".
-Substituted all str()'s for unicode()'s
-It's possible now to manually specify the path to GraphViz's executables in the case they can't be found automatically. The method 'set_graphviz_executables(paths)' will take a dictionary specifying the location of the executables. Please refer to the documentation for usage detailed information.
-And too many bugfixes to list..."

The `META.info` is a legacy, pre-Christmas name. While it's still currently supported, `META6.json` is the new name. And since a lot of people simply copy some module's  structure, the old name still proliferates, so we're trying to get rid of it for good  by sending PRs to any modules that use the old name, to switch to the modern name."

hol-light,1,3398,380,3778,Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master'
hol-light,1,1371,39,1410,"Added a new library file devoted to Jacobi symbols. The basic NxN->Z
version is ""jacobi"" and there is a ZxZ->Z version ""int_jacobi"". This
development doesn't explicitly break out the concept of Legendgre
symbol, since the Jacobi symbol cleanly subsumes it, but
""100/reciprocity.ml"" has an explicit definition if wanted, and the
proof here of reciprocity for the Jacobi symbol repurposes some of
that material, mainly the Gauss's Lemma variants. Also added various
supporting lemmas about integers and divisibility, products etc. So

hol-light,1,511,188,699,"Added some topological results related to the classic Sierpinski or
Hausdorff result on impossibility of decomposing sets into disjoint
countable closed unions, together with helper lemmas and a corollary about
cardinalities (PATH_CONNECTED_SPACE_IMP_UNCOUNTABLE). The main version
here, LOCALLY_CONNECTED_NOT_COUNTABLE_CLOSED_UNION, is closer to the
Hausdorff version since it assumes local connectedness rather than
compactness, but otherwise is quite general, applying to completely
metrizable spaces and locally compact Hausdorff spaces (in line with the
Baire Category Theorem versions). New theorems:

        miller_rabin_composite

bound that < 1/4 of (coprime) numbers are pseudoprime bases for a

bound in terms of phi(n) excluding the special case n = 9, while
MILLER_RABIN_PSEUDOPRIME_BOUND_LT and MILLER_RABIN_PSEUDOPRIME_BOUND

very similar theorems about orders of elements in the specific setting

hol-light,1,735,14,749,"Added a new library file ""Library/modmul_group.ml"" with a basic setup of
the multiplicative group of integers modulo n. This is more or less just
a straightforward combination of existing number-theoretic material with
explicitly group-theoretic language. For example, CYCLIC_MODMUL_GROUP
characterizes when this group is cyclic, and the core content here is
essentially the same as PRIMITIVE_ROOT_EXISTS in ""Library/primitive.ml"".
This file also includes a carefully totalized ""modular inverse"" function
more general than needed for the present setting, which always  gives
the following, the gcd collapsing to 1 in the ""intended"" coprime case:

hol-light,1,385,143,528,"Added a universal decision procedure for general integral domains,
INTEGRAL_DOMAIN_RULE, to the Library/ringtheory.ml development. This
is stylistically very like the core RING_RULE: it leverages all the
existing RING machinery via a mapping into a ""total"" integral domain,
and it tries to prove the claim outright but may add ring carrier
membership hypotheses, the basic ""integral_domain r"" hypothesis and
also potentially assertions about the characteristic of the general
form ""~(ring_char r divides n)"" for specific n. In principle
these characteristic-related extras can be more hypotheses than are
strictly needed, but that seldom occurs in typical examples without
many constants or many redundant assumptions. Also, they are always
of that stylized form even when they could be stated more naturally
with inequations or combined into one.

This is an example where all hypotheses are already provided:

 INTEGRAL_DOMAIN_RULE
   `!r x:Z. integral_domain r /\ ~(ring_char r divides 2) /\
            x IN ring_carrier r /\ ring_add r x x = ring_0 r

 INTEGRAL_DOMAIN_RULE
 `!x y:A. ring_add r x (ring_mul r (ring_of_int r (&15)) x) =
          ring_sub r y y
          ==> ring_mul r x y = ring_0 r`;;

Also added a more mundane but convenient decision procedure for
trivial facts about monomial operations, just using ARITH pointwise:
MONOMIAL_RULE, MONOMIAL_TAC, and the component tactic just doing the
pointwise reduction, MONOMIAL_POINTWISE_TAC. And finally, added a
small number of trivial theorems, mainly characteristic-related:

hol-light,1,1155,178,1333,"Added some material about monomial orderings.

First there is some general stuff about how monomial divisibility is a
partial order, and on a *finite* set of variables any preorder extending
it (in particular a ""compatible"" one) is automatically a WQO, hence
wellfounded, and hence WO whenever total.

Then there is a more general monomial ordering monomial_le/monomial_lt
over any set of variables (the monomials themselves are still finitely
supported). This is simply the classic Dershowitz-Manna multiset
ordering, which has all the main properties we want. It's parametrized by
a variable ordering, which can be either a reflexive or irreflexive
relation. Whatever the parametrizing ""order"" is, the overall monomial
order is at least reflexive and transitive and compatible with
multiplication. If the variable order is a partial order on variables it
is also equivalent to the Huet-Oppen form, and in the case of a total
order becomes a lexicographic order. It also inherits being a partial
order, total order, wellorder and being wellfounded in general from the
variable order. It is *not* designed to preserve any equivalences given a
non-antisymmetric variable order. New definitions:

Did various other augmentations and reshufflings of material on
wellfounded relations, transitive closures etc. Since the main
Library/wo.ml now contains Dickson's lemma, the other one in
Examples/dickson.ml is kept only as an alternative, and its core idea,
the Nash-Williams minimal bad sequence argument is factored out in a
more general setting (MINIMAL_BAD_SEQUENCE). The required property of
the ""bad"" predicate is essentially that it's a safety property, and
that reminded me to add a trivial but nice new example of the
safety-liveness decomposition, ""Examples/safetyliveness.ml""."

hol-light,1,296,281,577,"Made a small but far-reaching change in the material on orderings buried
inside ""Library/wo.ml"", switching from uncurried relations `:A#A->bool` to
curried ones `:A->A->bool`. This changes all the basic definitions like
""poset"", ""toset"", ""woset"", ""fl"" etc. and either the form or effective
content of many of the theorems there, albeit in a conceptually trivial
way. This is a first step in modernizing the ancient material here; it
originates as a port of HOL88 work done in 1992:

The curried form, while a bit less convenient to use with standard set
notions like ""UNION"", ""UNIONS"" etc., is consistent with the core
definition in ""wf.ml"" of WF (wellfounded), as well as with all the stuff
in ""Library/rstc.ml"" and ""Examples/reduct.ml"", and also with all the
concrete cases like ""<"" on number systems."

arbitrary sets of ""variables"" of any type; ""poly_ring R X"" corresponds
to the usual R[X] where X is a set of variables. For the univariate case
one can use a singleton set like {1} or (:1). There is no actual type of
monomials, polynomials or power series; they are simply collections of
(appropriately finitely supported) functions (X->N)->R. The individual
operations like ""poly_add"" (either over power series or polynomials) are
defined separately and then wrapped up in the overall ring construction.

  val it : thm = |- bit 7 (word_or x y) <=> bit 7 x \/ bit 7 y

Also made a slight improvement to RING_RULE, so that it properly handles
cases where the basic elements from a ring perspective are composite terms;
previously if subterms involved the type :A it could spoil some of the
internal reasoning and make the proof fail. Further added a tactic variant
RING_TAC, which is more or less a trivial wrapper round RING_RULE but allows
the option of leaving carrier membership subgoals at the end if they aren't
trivial from the goal's assumptions."
hol-light,1,882,0,882,"Added three different and complementary decision procedures for classes
of word problems. It would be possible to have a more sophisticated one
that combines some of these capacities, but for now we just have:

        1. WORD_RULE

        This is for cases where we are effectively just arguing by
        arithmetic modulo the wordsize in the style of INT_RING. For
        example:

            WORD_RULE
              `!x y. word_add (word_neg x) y = word 0
                     ==> word_add x (word_neg y) = word 0`;;

        2. WORD_BITWISE_RULE / WORD_BITWISE_TAC

        This is for cases where we are more or less just doing
        bitwise propositional reasoning (it doesn't work with
        shifts, though with a bit more effort it could be extended),
        e.g.

            WORD_BITWISE_RULE
             `!x y z:N word.
                   word_xor x y = z /\
                   word_or (word_xor x y) (word_xor z z) = word 0
                   ==> z = word 0`;;

        3. WORD_ARITH / WORD_ARITH_TAC

        These are for cases where the reasoning is effectively linear
        arithmetic, including signed or unsigned values, e.g. this
        standard trick for doing range tests with one compare using
        precomputed constants:

            WORD_ARITH
             `!a b x:N word.
                word_ilt a b
                ==> (word_ilt a x /\ word_ilt x b <=>
                     word_ult (word_sub x (word_add a (word 1)))
                              (word_add b (word_not a)))`;;

Added definitions of more word concepts: C-style conditionals, joining and
selecting subwords, zero and sign extension (or also contraction, despite
the name):

        word_cand
        word_cor
        word_join

hol-light,1,771,26,797,"Added a decision procedure for the universal theory of rings, RING_RULE.
This follows a pretty standard strategy (see my book ""Handbook of
Practical Logic and Automated Theorem Proving"", pp. 388-389): use
conjunctive normal form then appeal to convexity of the (Horn) theory
of rings to reduce to considering Horn clauses, solving them via the
equivalence with ideal membership using Groebner bases. As a HOL
derived rule, this is of course sound. It's not quite complete because
we are using Groebner bases over Q not Z, but in practice if the
original problem doesn't have non-trivial constants in, it usually
works.

The HOL Light version is a bit circuitous: first we instantiate the
generic normalizer (specifically intended for ""total"" operations)
to the case of rings whose carrier is an entire universe type. Then
we argue that we can always embed any ring in such a ring as a
subring (see the internal lemma RING_TOTALIZATION). While this is
a bit artificial, it allows maximum re-use of the carefully crafted
general normalization code, which would otherwise need to be
reimplemented in a more general setting. (I did make a couple of
tiny tweaks to ""grobner.ml"" as well: not strictly needed for this
but will be useful for later integral domain variants.) The rule
can be used directly on goals or explicitly given terms to
generate handy lemmas, e.g.

  RING_RULE
   `!a x:A.
        a IN ring_carrier r /\ x IN ring_carrier r /\
        ring_mul r a (ring_mul r x a) = a
        ==> ring_mul r a (ring_mul r (ring_mul r x (ring_mul r a x)) a) = a /\
            ring_mul r (ring_mul r x (ring_mul r a x))
                 (ring_mul r a (ring_mul r x (ring_mul r a x))) =
            ring_mul r x (ring_mul r a x)`;;

It's also permissible not to include the required carrier
membership assertions in the term given to RING_RULE, in which
case the returned theorem will include them (or those that seem
to be needed on naive grounds) as an antecedent, e.g.

  RING_RULE
   `!a b:C.
          (?c. c IN ring_carrier r /\ ring_mul r c a = b) /\
          (?d. d IN ring_carrier r /\ ring_mul r b d = a)
          ==> (ring_neg r a = ring_0 r <=> ring_0 r = b)`;;

  ...

  val it : thm =
    |- !a b.
           a IN ring_carrier r /\ b IN ring_carrier r
           ==> (?c. c IN ring_carrier r /\ ring_mul r c a = b) /\
               (?d. d IN ring_carrier r /\ ring_mul r b d = a)
           ==> (ring_neg r a = ring_0 r <=> ring_0 r = b)

Added a few more miscellaneous ring lemmas, and more systematically
defined the concept of a von Neumann regular ring, ""vnregular_ring"".
(The way it's stated with is maybe a bit artificial, since we're only
considering commutative rings, but it works fine and perhaps looks
more intuitive.) Here RING_RULE is actually quite handy for some of
the algebraic manipulations.

Also fixed up a few duplications and naming issues in the ring stuff,
both removing pointless theorems that are duplicates of others

        RING_DIVIDES_INTEGER_RING [duplicates INTEGER_RING_DIVIDES]

        RING_UNIT_INTEGER_RING    [duplicates INTEGER_RING_UNIT]

and eliminating a name conflict over RING_HOMOMORPHISM_RING_OF_INT,
renaming one of the theorems

        RING_HOMOMORPHISM_RING_OF_INT
        -> RING_HOMOMORPHISM_INTEGER_RING_OF_INT

and making a corresponding change for naming consistency

        RING_MONOMORPHISM_RING_OF_INT
        -> RING_MONOMORPHISM_INTEGER_RING_OF_INT

hol-light,1,1973,1,1974,"Added a new file with a basic theory of machine words via the type
`:N word` of N-bit words. Here `:N` is a type of size N, so we are using
essentially the same indexing scheme as in the Multivariate theories for
vectors of size N. Note that this builds in a priori the assumption the
wordsize is nonzero.

Mappings `val:N word->num` and `word:num->N word` for unsigned values, and
similar 2s-complement `ival:N word->int` and `iword:int->word`, cast
(reducing modulo word in one direction) between words and numbers. The
`bit` function gives a specific bit as a Boolean.

The usual operations are provided like `word_add`, `word_xor`; currently
for explicitness we don't overload the usual operators. Some have signed

Patch Subject:  TMP FIXES FOR TELE HEALTH
Description:

============
 This patch addresses three issues introduced by installing patch
 SD*5.3*704:
  1. # 1120361 - After installing the patch, undefined errors for routine
  SDTMPHLA were found in the VistA error trap at several sites. The
  ""<UNDEFINED>EN+39^SDTMPHLA"" error was caused because the status of the
  new appointment was not being checked for the correct status condition.
  As a result, variables were not set correctly and caused the process to
  abort. This patch corrects the check of the appointment status.
  2. # 1120407: - After installing the patch, errors were found at several
  VistA sites in routine SDTMPHLB. These errors were
  ""<COMMAND>EN+11^SDTMPHLB *Function must return a value at
  CHKCLIN+1^SDTMPH"" this error is caused when a clinic setup
  has a primary stop code but the secondary stop code field is not
  populated. The function that checks the stop codes has been corrected to
  return a value when either of the stop codes are defined or is null.
  3. # 1120947: - This patch also modifies the new cross reference on the
  Hospital Location File (#44) to only fire when the editing of a clinic
  completes. As originally installed, the cross reference fired after each
  field was entered. This field level trigger caused other required
  variables to not be defined as the message was created and caused the
  edit of the clinic to abort.

Patch Subject:  TIU TEXT EVENT NOT SENDING ALERT
Description:

============
 This patch will resolve the following issues in the Text Integration

 1. INC4179486 - Post-Signature alert using text event not sending alert
    Duplicate(s):
    INC5332570 - TIU1305 patch question... unable to add post signature

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC4179486 - Post-Signature alert using text event not sending alert
 Problem 1:
 -----------
 If the first Internal Entry Number (IEN) in TIU TEXT EVENTS (#8925.71)
 file has INCLUDE SPACES=NO, and no matches are found during the search for
 that first IEN, then all subsequent searches will be missed.
 The ""CASE SENSITIVE"" parameter is not working as designed. The code
 automatically converts all the search strings to lowercase. When the code
 loops through each line of the TIU note, it also automatically converts
 each line of text to lowercase.
 The ""INCLUDE SPACES"" parameter is not working, when the code loops through
 each line of the TIU note, setting this parameter to ""no"" strips all
 spaces out of the TIU line. That means when this parameter is ""no"", then
 the Search Text should be entered without any spaces.
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 This functionality was added with patch TIU*1.0*296 and has the flaws
 noted in the problem listed above.
 When the first IEN in TIU TEXT EVENTS (#8925.71) file has INCLUDE SPACES =
 NO and the corresponding search text is not found in the note text, then
 no other TIU Events' search text will work.  The 'Include Spaces'
 functionality is also flawed in that when it was set to NO, spaces were
 only stripped from the TIU Note text and not from the search text.  This
 patch removes the prompt for INCLUDE SPACES and spaces will now be removed
 from both search text as well as TIU note text during the text search
 comparison.
 The Case Sensitivity functionality was not fully programmed and will be
 removed since case sensitivity would increase the odds of an alert not
 being sent due only to a case mismatch.  This patch removes the prompt for
 CASE SENSITIVE from the Text Event Edit [TIU TEXT EVENT EDIT] option and
 the search will not be case sensitive.
 When testing this patch, it was also found that when the Visit Search
 String is entered in lower case, it is then compared to each VISIT
 LOCATION names without converting to upper case (VISIT LOCATION (#5)
 fields are always stored in upper case).  Routine TIUTIUS was also
 modified to convert the Visit Search String to upper case for comparison
 to all VISIT LOCATION names.
 2. INC4799473 - TIU Text Alerts code does not work for addendums
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 MUMPS code 'D TASK^TIUTIUS(DA)' entered in the POST-SIGNATURE CODE (#4.9)
 field of the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#8925.1) file causes signature of
 the addendum to a TIU documents to initiate scanning the parent document
 for TIU Text Event alert phrases. This is incorrect as the parent document
 was scanned upon its signature and the text in the addendum is not
 scanned.
 Resolution 2:
 -------------
 This functionality was added with patch TIU*1.0*296 and has the flaws
 noted in the problem listed above.
 When an addendum was signed it did not search for any text in that
 addendum because the parent IEN was passed to the routine instead of the
 addendum's IEN. After the installation of this patch, post signature code
 will now need to be set to D TASK^TIUTIUS($S($G(DAORIG):DAORIG,1:DA)) in
 order to correctly search either a parent note or addendum when each is
 signed.
 Also, during investigation of these issues, it was found that there was no
 fail-safe code to execute the post-signature search (DQ^TIUTIUS) if it
 failed to run it as a background task.  Code was added to run it in the
 foreground if the background failed to run.

Patch Subject:  START DATE ISSUE/CLINIC ORDER/ORDER FREQUENCY
Description:

============
 This patch will address the following issues.
 1. INC3307676-Inconsistency on updating start date when editing a starred
    field and a non-starred field depending on when you perform the edit.
 2. INC3400229-Patient on Specific Drugs (PSD) Not Displaying Clinic Order
    When Division Selected.
 3. INC3835935-Order changed in VistA, creating a new order. Bar Code
    Medication Administration (BCMA) does not show the new active order;
    only shows discontinued order.
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 -----------------------------
 HITPS-6504:  Inpatient Medication Orders with Invalid Frequency Do Not
 Populate on BCMA's Virtual Due List
 Summary: Where the medication route is edited, a new order is created.
 The new order does not contain a valid Frequency, and, therefore, cannot
 be displayed on BCMA's Virtual Due List (VDL). This problem occurs when a
 user is set to Auto-Verify inpatient med orders.
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC3307676 - There is an inconsistency for updating start date when
                 editing a starred field and a non-starred field depending
                 on when you perform the edit.
 Problem:
 --------
 It was reported that after editing the Start Date/Time field for an
 IV-Inpatient order and then modifying the Administration Times field via
 Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option for the second order of the same
 medication, the Start Date/Time gets changed automatically to something
 else other than what was entered. This happens when the two fields are
 edited simultaneously.
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change was made to the intravenous (IV) Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
 option to prevent re-calculation of the Start Date/Time when the field is
 manually being edited by the user.
 The routine PSGOEF has been modified at line tag FINISH+2 to re-initialize
 the PSIVCAL variable.
 2. INC3400229 - PSD Not Displaying Clinic Order When Division Selected
 Problem:
 --------
 Orlando Inpatient staff identified an issue when using the Patients on
 Specific Drug(s) [PSJ PDV] option to list orders of selected patient
 where certain Clinic Orders are not displayed if the user selects a
 specific division. If the user does not pre-select a specific Division and
 instead accepts the default of ALL Divisions the Clinic Order will appear.
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The logic of the Patients on Specific Drug(s) report has been modified to
 include the Inpatient clinic orders when generating the report for a
 specific division.
 3. INC3835935 - Order changed in VistA, creating a new order. BCMA does
    not show the new active order; only shows discontinued order
    INC2390586 - TVH -- Invalid Frequency received from order (Duplicate)
 Problem:
 --------
 The Tennessee Valley Healthcare System - Alvin C. York (Murfreesboro)
 Campus and VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System H.J. Heinz Campus sites
 reported issues with orders disappearing from BCMA right after being
 finished by pharmacy.
 It was determined that the cause of the problem is that the FREQUENCY
 (in minutes) (#42) field in the UNIT DOSE (#55.06) sub-file in the
 PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) file was getting deleted after the MED ROUTE (#3)
 field was edited prior or after finishing a pending unit dose order from
 CPRS when the Auto-Verify parameter for the user performing the edit is
 set to YES.
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed the software to preserve the variable used to store the order
 frequency value after the MED ROUTE (#3) field is edited.
 NEWed the variable PSGS0XT at 3^PSGOE8 and 3^PSGOE9. This variable is
 used to store the Order frequency and was being overwritten after the MED
 ROUTE (#3) field was being edited, which is handled by these two entry
 points.

Patch Subject:  ADD CHRYSANTHEMUM TO FHSLEA2
Description:

============
 This patch will address the addition of a new Drug/Food allergy by adding
 CHRYSANTHEMUM to the mapping capability for food preference dislikes.
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):

 HITPS-1123 (formerly PSPO 1380)
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 -------------------------------------------
 1. INC5943993 - FH Patch needed for CHRYSANTHEMUM: A DRUG, FOOD allergy
 type
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has recently added
 CHRYSANTHEMUM as a DRUG,FOOD allergy type to the GMR ALLERGIES file
 (#120.82). It is intended for the tea and herbal supplements made from
 chrysanthemum. This new DRUG,FOOD allergy type must be added to the
 routine FHSELA to be mapped as an allergy type food preference dislike in
 the Dietetics package.
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 Routine FHSELA2 has a hard-coded list of food allergies. It presents this
 hard-coded list to the user when adding a food allergy preference dislike
 to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) and then maps it to a matching
 record in the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82). The new allergy has been added
 to the hard-coded list of food allergies in routine FHSELA2 so that it may
 be presented to the user.

Patch Subject:  CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE RX FILLED WITH STATUS OF SUSPENSE
Description:

============
 This patch will resolve the following issue.
 1. INC5826460 - user allowed to release Rx from the vault inventory even
 though the prescription was still on suspense.
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC5826460 - user allowed to release Rx from the vault inventory even
 though the prescription was still on suspense.
 Problem:
 --------
 Affected end-user was allowed to release Rx 20181136 from the vault
 inventory even though the prescription was still on suspense with no
 label being printed.
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify code to not allow a controlled substance Rx to be filled that has a
 status of SUSPENDED.
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed routine PSDOPT1+4 adding code to set PSDOUT=1 if the RX has a
 status of SUSPENDED so that the user will not be able to fill the RX but
 instead will be prompted to enter another Rx number.

Patch Subject:  COMPLETE ORDERS FROM OERR SECONDARY FILTER ERROR
Description:

============
 When choosing a primary sort of PATIENT or ROUTE and secondary sort of
 FLAGGED, no orders are displayed. Also, when changing orderable item
 on a prescription, if the units are omitted from the dose, the DISPENSE
 UNITS PER DOSE field is computed incorrectly.
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC3902798 - PSO*7*505 Flagged Order Sorting Issue
 Problem:
 -------
 Patient has 2 Pending Orders, one is flagged and one is not flagged.
 If Primary sort is flagged, I see the flagged order. If primary sort is
 Patient or Route, I see the unflagged orders. But if Primary sort is
 Patients/all or Route, and my secondary sort is flagged, I don't see the
 flagged order or unflagged order.
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routines PSOORFI3, PSOORFI5 and PSOORFIN were modified to only exclude the
 flagged orders if the secondary sort is not flagged.
 2. INC3796474 - VISTA does not calculate correctly when changing orderable
 item strengths. This issue is related to Patient Safety Issue HITPS-6473.
 Problem:
 -------
 When changing the orderable item for a prescription, if the new dose is
 entered without units, the default quantity displayed for dispense units
 field is incorrect.
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine PSOBKDED was modified to compute the correct dispense units even
 if the units are omitted in the answer.

Patch Subject:  DSS FY 2020 ANNUAL SUSTAINMENT
Description:

============
 ***********************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with an Emergency status because of  **
 ** the shortened compliance date and must be installed in all        **
 ** systems no later than the compliance requirement date. This patch **
 ** must be installed on or before 11/05/19 so that the October DSS   **
 ** Extracts can be generated using the updated Fiscal Year 20 logic. **
 ** Failure to comply with the installation date will cause delays in **
 ** extracting and reporting data.                                    **
 ***********************************************************************
 The MCAO FY20 Extract Enhancements shall provide the means of exporting
 data from selected VistA software modules and transmitting it to an MCAO
 database residing at the AITC (Austin Information Technology Center). This
 transfer is accomplished through a set of extract routines, intermediate
 files, and transmission routines. Data from VistA packages is stored by
 the extract routines in the intermediate files, where it is temporarily
 available for local use and auditing. The data is then transmitted to the
 AITC, where it is formatted and uploaded into commercial software.
 Included in the MCAO FY20 scope are:
      o       MCAO Extract field additions and modifications
      o       MCAO menu additions and modifications
      o       MCAO report modifications
      o       Changes related to user, technical, or business
              documentation.

     of the data in the pharmacy package.
 9.  Modified the PRO extract logic so that all monthly rental transactions
     will be expressed in days, rather than months.  In addition, various
     prosthetics reports were updated to include a note indicating that
     monthly rentals are now expressed in days.
 10. Modified the SUR extract logic to get the stop code for outpatient
     procedures. If no associated clinic can be identified, then the stop
     code will default to 435 for NON-OR based procedures or 429 for all
     other procedures. The encounter number logic was also modified to use
     the stop code provided without changing it due to the surgical
     specialty.
 11. Modified the feeder key logic to create an NDC when the pharmacy item
     is a drug item and does not have an NDC code assigned and isn't
     linked to a national drug file entry. In those cases, the NDC portion
     of the feeder key will be the letters ""LCD"" concatenated with the IEN
     of the item from file 50.  If the IEN is less than 9 characters, the
     number will be left padded with zeroes. The previously added ""LCL""
     logic for supply items was modified to only update when both the NDC
     and the national drug file link were missing.
 12. Removed options Add/Edit Lab Results Translation Table and Lab
     Results Extract Untranslatable Results Report from the Lab
     Maintenance menu.  The Lab Results DSS LOINC Code Report option was
     moved from the Lab Maintenance menu to the Maintenance menu.  The Lab
     Maintenance menu was also deleted.
 13. Modified the MOV extract logic so that the treating specialty at
     discharge is now stored in the TREATING SPECIALTY field.  In addition,
     the description and technical description were updated in the TREATING
     SPECIALTY field.
 14. Created a new report for cost by feeder key for each of the pharmacy
     related extracts; IVP, PRE, UDP, and BCM.
 15. Modified the LAB extract logic to obtain CPT codes for all workload
     where CPT code information is available.  Previously, this was only
     collected for specific lab workload.
 16. Changed field name from COST OF TRANSACTION to PLACEHOLD COST OF
     TRANSACTION in the PRO extract as the field is being replaced.
 17. Changed field name from LAB LABOR COST to PLACEHOLD LAB LABOR COST in
     the PRO extract as the field is being replaced.
 18. Changed field name from LAB MATERIAL COST to PLACEHOLD LAB MATERIAL
     COST in the PRO extract as the field is being replaced.
 19. Added field NEW COST OF TRANSACTION to the PRO extract and modified
     the PRO extract logic to populate the field.
 20. Added field NEW LAB LABOR COST to the PRO extract and modified the
     PRO extract logic to populate the field.
 21. Added field NEW LAB MATERIAL COST to the PRO extract and modified the
     PRO extract logic to populate the field.
 22. Modified the MOV extract to remove the TYPE field as it is no longer
     needed.
 23. Changed field name from DSS IP# to PLACEHOLD DSS IP# in the CLI, ECS,
     ECQ, IVP, LAB, LBB, PRE, PRO, RAD, and UDP extracts as the field is no
     longer needed.
 24. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER SC to PLACEHOLD ENCOUNTER SC in the
     LAB, LBB, LAR, PRE, PRO, and RAD extracts as the field is no longer
     needed.
 25. Modified the instructions for capturing output to be exported to be
     consistent with the current reflections software.
 26. Modified the Print Feeder Locations Report so that the user can
     select one, many, or all feeder systems.  In addition, the station
     number associated with each feeder location is now included in the
     report.
 27. Created a new report that will show institution and division
     information for the site.
 28. Modified the BCM extract logic to handle values in the unit of
     administration and doses given fields of the BCMA MEDICATION LOG file
     that could be incorrectly processed as exponential numbers.
 29. Modified the Pharmacy Unusual Volume report so that any entries that
     could be incorrectly processed as exponential numbers are correctly
     handled.
 30. Modified the Prosthetics Rental Report so that all rentals are
     displayed. Added the ability to sort by division and added the unit of
     issue and division to the report.
 31. Modified the UDP extract so that the setting of the division is based
     on the ward if it's an inpatient or on the clinic if it's a clinic
     medication (inpatient medication for outpatients).
 32. Updated the help text for the Action to Send prompt in the Enter/Edit
     Clinic Parameters option to reflect recent changes.
 33. Modified the Print Feeder Keys option to allow for sorting the PHA
     feeder system by drug or non-drug.  Also modified the logic so that
     feeder keys that contain LCL or LCD are included.
 34. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER CAMP LEJEUNE to PLACEHOLD ENC CAMP
     LEJEUNE in the LAR, PRE, PRO, and RAD extracts as the field is no
     longer needed.
 35. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER SHAD to PLACEHOLD ENCOUNTER SHAD in
     the PRE and PRO extracts as the field is no longer needed.
 36. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER CV to PLACEHOLD ENCOUNTER CV in the
     PRE and PRO extracts as the field is no longer needed.
 37. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER SWAC to PLACEHOLD ENCOUNTER SWAC
     in the PRE and PRO extracts as the field is no longer needed.
 38. Changed field name from AGENT ORANGE ENC INDICATOR to PLACEHOLD
     AGENT ORANGE ENC in the PRO and PRE extracts as the field is no longer
     needed.
 39. Changed field name from ENC HEAD/NECK CA to PLACEHOLD ENC HEAD/NECK CA
     in the PRO and PRE extracts as the field is no longer needed.
 40. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER MST to PLACEHOLD ENCOUNTER MST in
     the PRO and PRE extracts as the field is no longer needed.
 41. Changed field name from RADIATION ENCOUNTER INDICATOR to PLACEHOLD
     RADIATION ENCOUNTER in the PRO and PRE extracts as the field is no
     longer needed.
 42. Changed field name from SHARING AGREEMENT INSURANCE to PLACEHOLD
     SHARE AGREEMNT INSUR in the ADM, PRE, and PRO extracts as the field is
     no longer needed.
 43. Changed field name from SHARING AGREEMENT INSURANCE CO to PLACEHOLD
     SHARE AGREEMNT INSUR in the CLI extract as the field is no longer
     needed.
 44. Modified the admission and movement extract audit reports to give
     additional information about ASIH other facility movements.
 45. Added field NON-COUNT FLAG to the CLI extract and modified the CLI
     extract logic to populate the field.
 46. Added field STATE HOME NAME to the ECS extract and modified the ECS
     extract logic to populate the field.
 47. Modified the missing clinics email that is sent when the CLI extract
     is run and the clinic isn't found in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file
     (#728.44). Previously, the email was showing the IEN of the stop code.
     It was updated to show the actual stop code.
 48. Added field VISTA DEA SPECIAL HDLG to the BCM, IVP, PRE, and UDP
     extracts and modified the extract logic in each to populate the field.
 49. Changed field name from LAB RESULTS TRANSLATION to PLACEHOLD LAB
     RESULTS TRANS in the LAR extract as the field is no longer needed.
 50. Modified the logic in the PRE extract so that prescriptions that are
     part of the Community Care Network (CCN) program are identified in the
     REMARKS field of the PRESCRIPTION EXTRACT file (#727.81).

Patch Subject:  CMOP REJECTION CAUSES ERRANT NOT DISPENSED MESSAGE
Description:

============
 When entering a duplicate prescription, if the original prescription was
 sent to CMOP, rejected and filled locally, then the discontinue message
 will report that the original prescription was not filled.
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC5520639 - When entering a duplicate prescription, if the original
 prescription was sent to CMOP, rejected and filled locally, then the
 discontinue message will report that the original prescription was not
 filled.
 Problem:
 -------
 The CMOP portion of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) reports that the
 prescription was not filled. However, it was filled locally. The software
 does not currently check for that situation.
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine PSODDPRE was modified to check for local release if a prescription
 was rejected by CMOP. It will display the message ""Dispensed locally NOT
 by CMOP"".

Patch Subject:  CROC ERROR FIX
Description:

============
 This patch will resolve the following issue:
 INC1289467 - Getting error message whenever a Pharmacist tries to
              verify a controlled substance order entered by a Technician.
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC1289467 - Getting error message whenever a Pharmacist tries to
                 verify a controlled substance order entered by a
                 Technician.
 Problem:
 --------
 It was reported by White City that if a controlled substance order was
 placed by pharmacy technician and the ""OPIOID TREATMENT
 REMINDER"" reminder check is active and triggered by the order, the
 software will generate a hard code error during pharmacist verifying the
 ""NON-VERIFIED"" order and because of that Pharmacists are not able to
 verify Technician-entered controlled substance prescriptions.
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch fixes the <UNDEFINED> issue by restoring the original values
 of the needed variables.
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 The <UNDEFINED> error is generated as a result of calling a Clinical
 Reminder Order Check (CROC) which kills the VADM and VA variables.
 This patch modifies routine PSOCROC label CK+4 to restore the VADM and VA
 local variable arrays to the original values after calling Clinical
 Reminder.

Patch Subject:  MHA SCALE FIXES AND REPORT UPDATES
Description:

============
 This patch updates the following Mental Health instruments:
 AIMS (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale)
   A disclaimer is no longer added when the progress note text is
   generated.
 C-SSRS (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale)
   A Key Indicator is now added if the response to question 3 is 'Yes'.
 MMPI-2-RF (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 - Restructured
 Form)
   The T-score for the EID (Emotional/Internalizing Dysfunction) scale
   is now correct.
   The score for the PSYC-r (Psychoticism-Revised) scale now accounts for
   the value of question 216.
 QOLI (Quality of Life Inventory)
   A scoring error originally introduced in YS*5.01*139 is corrected.
 If the administration of an instrument with many scales preceded an
 instrument with fewer scales during a session, additional scales were
 sometimes carried over to the second instrument.  This was visible in the
 Health Summary component and TIU objects.  It could also affect the
 display of Special Reports.  This is corrected with this patch.
 Additionally, the patch checks previous administrations to make sure each
 administration has only the correct scales associated.
 Additional record locks were added to the PSYCH INSTRUMENT PATIENT file
 (#601.2) to reduce the likelihood of errors when generating a report for a
 legacy instrument.

============
 IFCAP patch, PRC*5.1*209, addresses the following issues:
 If there is not a unique Appropriation Code for a Fund Control Point
 (FCP), an error will be prompted warning that it is not unique.
 When an appropriation in a no-year fund has an incorrect value for
 the Fiscal Year, it will display an error saying it is the wrong fiscal
 year.

                 a/o, program, fcp/prj, object class, and job!
    Problem:
    --------
    When trying to edit a FCP, a warning is displayed stating that it is
    not unique. This occurs when multiple FCPs are being added to a single
    Appropriation Code.
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routine PRCB1A has been modified to allow multiple FCPs for a
    single appropriation code.
 2. INC3384170 - VISTA FINANCIAL
    Problem:
    --------
    If a user attempts to enter/edit a no-year 1358 using menu option New
    1358 Request [PRCEC NEW] or 2237 using option New 2237 (Service)
    Request [PRCSENRB], but the Fiscal Year appropriation does not contain
    an uppercase 'X' or match the funds appropriation, it will display the
    user with an error saying the fiscal year is not correct. This can be
    caused because a no-year fund will have a Beginning Budget Fiscal Year
    less than the current Fiscal Year being used.
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines PRCSEB and PRCEN have been modified to check the Fiscal
    Years appropriation number in the Fund Control Point (#420) file. An
    additional check to see if the appropriation is a no-year fund has been
    added for lowercase 'x', as well as uppercase 'X'.

Patch Subject:  REPORT PAGINATION INCORRECT / CPRS ORDER DETAILS
Description:

============
 This patch will resolve the following issues:
 1. INC5135935 - Tech order entry in VistA not being converted to
                 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) note correctly.
 2. INC5849471 - Outpatient Rx Profile report has incorrect page numbering.

 1. INC5135935 - Tech order entry in VistA not being converted to CPRS note
                 correctly.
 Problem:
 --------
 Wichita Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) reported that when
 outpatient orders placed by a technician in backdoor pharmacy and verified
 by pharmacist, the name of the technician appears under the ""Pharmacist""
 field of the CPRS order details screen. The VERIFYING PHARMACIST (#104)
 field of the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file and not the FINISHING PERSON (#38)
 field should show up under the ""Pharmacist"" field of the CPRS order
 details screen.
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch makes a code change to check if the order is having a VERIFYING
 PHARMACIST (#104) field, then to pull that data value as the ""Pharmacist""
 field on the CPRS details of the order.
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed routine PSOORRL at OEL+11 label to get the data of the
 ""Pharmacist"" field of the CPRS order details from the VERIFYING
 PHARMACIST (#104) field first. Otherwise, to pull it from the FINISHING
 PERSON (#38) field.
 2. INC5849471 - Outpatient Rx Profile report has incorrect page numbering.
 Problem:
 --------
 When printing the Outpatient Rx Profile report the report will display the
 first 2 pages numbered with page 1. The first page 1 includes the patient
 name/DOB/address as a header and the 2nd page is numbered page 1
 incorrectly.
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch makes code changes that correct the pagination of the
 Outpatient RX Profile Report.
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed routines PSODEMSB and PSOPATLK so that any logical use of the
 variable PG is updated to use the variable PAGE.

 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Complete Orders from eRx [PSO ERX FINISH] option, the
 ERX DEFAULT LOOKBACK DAYS field (#10.2) of the OUTPATIENT SITE file
 (#59) displayed with the current date when the field is not populated.
 If the field #10.2 is blank, the display on screen header for this field
 should go back 365 days instead of current date.
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch fixes the issue by displaying the populated value of
 the ERX DEFAULT LOOKBACK DAYS field (#10.2). Otherwise, the printout
 will go back to 365.
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changes were made to HDR^PSOERX and HDR^PSOERXC1 routines to print the
 correct value in the header line.
 2. INC6192115 - Selection prompt of (1-1) with patch PSO*7*551
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Complete Orders from eRx [PSO ERX FINISH] option with
 the following conditions:
  - No records found
  - Selecting the 'SP-SELECT PATIENT' action
 The software prompts the user with ""Enter a number (1-1):"" even though
 there is no data to select from.
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch fixes the issue by prompting the ""Enter a number (1-1):"" only
 if records are available to select from.
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Change was made to PATDATA^PSOERXC1 routine to not allow selection
 prompt if no entries are found.

Description:

============
 SD*5.3*728 provides Fiscal Year 2020 updates to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7)
 file as requested by the Office of Finance, Managerial Cost Accounting
 Office (MCAO).
                          *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 *  This patch is being released with a compliance date of October 1,     *
 *  2019 and should be installed as close to Close of Business (COB) on   *
 *  September 30, 2019 as possible, but not after October 1, 2019. Early  *
 *  installation of this patch could result in transmission of incorrect  *
 *  Stop Codes that will result in errors from Austin.  Coordination with *
 *  the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS (Program Application     *
 *  Specialist)/ADPAC (Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator) *
 *  is imperative as SD*5.3*728 will cause changes to the CLINIC STOP     *
 *  (#40.7) file. Testing can be done in a site's mirror account before   *
 *  installation in production to verify changes. SD*5.3*728 modifies and *
 *  creates Stop Codes effective October 1, 2019; therefore, installing   *
 *  early may modify certain Stop Codes that may currently be in use at   *
 *  your site.  It is advised that clinics with Stop Codes assigned that  *
 *  will incur restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon  *
 *  as possible after installation. Please keep in mind that new Stop     *
 *  Codes should not be assigned in MAS/Scheduling until October 1, 2019  *
 *  as the PCE encounters bearing FY20 Stop Codes will not be accepted in *
 *  Austin until that date.  All other MAS Stop Code changes should be    *
 *  made as early as possible on October 1, 2019.                         *
 **************************************************************************
 Instructions for the FY20 Stop Code Patch:
 SD*5.3*728 makes additions and changes to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file
 as of October 1, 2019. No clinic can be created using any new Stop Codes
 contained in the patch until after this patch is implemented.
 Scheduling & IRM should coordinate to perform the following sequence:
 1. IRM installs the patch late on September 30 or early on October 1,
    2019.
 2. Scheduling staff: Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report
    [SD CLN STOP CODE REP] to list those clinics that need changes in the
    HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file for FY20.
 3. Scheduling staff: Make changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44)
    file so that the clinics will have the correct Stop Codes in place
    for October 1st clinic appointments.
 MCA Staff:
 1. Before October 1 (prior to installation of the patch) run Option 2:
    Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] from the Setup for DSS
    Clinic Information menu [ECX SETUP CLINIC].
 2. Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract for September 2019.
    It is the create and edit, not the 'approve', that changes the values
    included in the CLI extract.  Perform normal AUDITS for the CLI
    Extract.
 3. DO NOT make changes for October clinics at this time.
 4. Between October 12 and 31, after auditing and receiving confirmation
    of successful deblocking of the transmitted September CLI Extract,
    proceed with FY20 Stop Code changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes
    Worksheet:
    a. After the September extract has been run, transmitted and is
       considered final (in your mind, no re-run/re-transmit needed), you
       may run Option 2 CREATE DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD].
       This option creates local entries in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES
       (#728.44) file and compares this file to the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44)
       file to see if there are any differences since the last time the
       file was reviewed.
    b. After Option 2 has completed, use the Option 3:  Clinics and DSS
       Stop Codes Print [ECXSCLIST].  This option produces a worksheet of
       (A) All Clinics, (C) Active, (I) Inactive, or only the (U)
       Unreviewed Clinics that are awaiting approval.
    c. Run Option 7:  Clinic & Stop Codes Validity Report [ECX STOP CODE
       VALIDITY].  This step will check that all Stop Codes conform.
       Note:  a 'blank' output indicates there are no problems with Stop

 Tele Health Management Platform (TMP) is implementing processes that will
 keep Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) clinic and appointment data for tele health clinics and
 appointments in sync with the TMP application. These real time updates
 are triggered when appointments are made or cancelled in a clinic
 that has a stop code or credit stop code that is associated with tele
 health.
 Real-time clinic updates are triggered when a new tele health clinic is
 added at a medical center or if the stop code, credit stop code, clinic
 name, treating specialty, service, or overbooks allowed fields are
 edited. A real-time clinic update is also triggered if a tele health
 clinic is inactivated or if an inactive tele health clinic is
 reactivated. Tele health clinics are identified by stop code or credit
 stop codes.
 The current Get Consults (ORQQCN LIST) Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
 doesn't return the Clinically Indicated Date (CID) when the consults are
 returned to the calling application. TMP is replacing the call to the RPC
 with an HL7 query/response message. The new process returns a list of the
 patient's consults over the last two years and includes the CID field with
 the data if it is available. Displaying the CID with the consult in TMP
 provides the scheduler with the information needed to schedule an
 appointment for the consults within the 30 day window after the CID.
 If end users/customers need TMP technical support during Go Live or
 anytime thereafter, they can reach out to the National Telehealth
 Technology Help Desk (NTTHD) at 866-651-3180 or via email at
 VHA_NTTHD@domain.ext.

Patch Subject:  INVOKE SDAM APPOINTMENT EVENTS FROM VS GUI
Description:

============
 This patch corrects the problem of appointment processing in VistA
 Scheduling (VS) Graphical User Interface (GUI) not invoking the event
 driver protocol (SDAM APPOINTMENT EVENTS) that roll and scroll VistA does.
 This protocol allows other apps to tie functionality, including interfaces
 to external systems such as Pyxis, Omnicell, and Emergency Department
 Information System (EDIS), to appointment events. Actions currently being
 executed for appointment events in legacy VistA will also be executed for
 appointments when those events (make appointment, check in, undo check in,
 check out, undo check out, cancel appointment, no show) are triggered by
 the GUI. (However, this patch does not require a GUI update.)

 -----------------------------------------------
 1. I17005764FY18 Pyxis and EDIS are not recognizing clinic check in
 actions.
 Problem:
 -------
 When a user performs appointment actions in VS GUI, downstream systems such
 as Pyxis (or other unit dosing devices, such as Omnicell) and EDIS are not
 updated, whereas they are when the appointment actions are taken in legacy
 VistA.
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The GUI now invokes the SDAM APPOINTMENT EVENTS protocol just like legacy
 VistA, meaning that the downstream systems will be notified in the same
 way whether actions are taken on them in GUI or legacy.
 2.  Status in Appointment file (#409.84) not updated by no show
 scheduling action.
 Problem:
 -------
 When the no show action is performed in VS GUI, the status of the
 appointment is not changed to NO SHOW.
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) now sets the NO SHOW status in the
 Appointment file.
 3. Rational ID 865407 Pharmacy Automated Dispensing Equipment (PADE)
 Protocol Fix
 Problem:
 -------
 Parent Defect for the PADE protocol issues.
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The Scheduling RPC's used by VSE GUI did not invoke the SD APPOINTMENTS
 EVENT protocol. This patch adds that functionality.
 4. Rational ID 839958 EDIS patch protocol trigger
 Problem:
 -------
 The EDIS patch requires the scheduling protocol trigger protocol to function
 with events from VS GUI in order to process those events. The existing patch
 will not work and cannot be completely tested until the Protocol is functional.
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The Scheduling RPC's used by VSE GUI did not invoke the SD APPOINTMENTS
 EVENT protocol. This patch adds that functionality.
 5. Rational ID 839957 SDAM APPOINTMENT EVENT protocol
 Problem:
 -------
 It is necessary for the VS GUI to update the SDAM APPOINTMENT EVENT protocol
 with any changes in the same way Roll and Scroll VistA does.
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The Scheduling RPC's used by VSE GUI did not invoke the SD APPOINTMENTS
 EVENT protocol. This patch adds that functionality.
 6. Rational ID 839533 Omnicell/Pyxis/PADE patch protocol trigger
 Problem:
 -------
 The Omnicell/Pyxis/PADE patch requires the scheduling protocol trigger protocol
 to function with events from VS GUI in order to process those events. The
 existing patch will not work and cannot be completely tested until the
 protocol is functional.
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The Scheduling RPC's used by VSE GUI did not invoke the SD APPOINTMENTS
 EVENT protocol. This patch adds that functionality.
 7. Rational ID 836671 Support Event Driver Protocols to Correct Integration of
 Medical Devices
 Problem:
 -------
 Research by the Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) team has revealed that the
 issues currently being looked into regarding integration with unit dose
 devices, such as Pyxis and Omnicell, as well as EDIS, could be resolved by
 hooking up the implemented but uncalled event driver protocol for VS GUI
 events.
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The Scheduling RPC's used by VSE GUI did not invoke the SD APPOINTMENTS
 EVENT protocol. This patch adds that functionality.

 *********************************************************************
 The Community Care Referrals and Authorizations (CCR&A) application is an
 enterprise-wide system used by Community Care (CC) staff to automatically
 generate referrals and authorizations for all Veterans receiving care in
 the community. Clinical and VA CC staff located at VA Medical Centers,
 Outpatient Clinics, Community Based Outpatient Clinics, and Veterans
 Integrated Service Network offices use this application.  The CCR&A
 solution is an integral component of the VA Community Care Information
 Technology (IT) architecture that allows Veterans to receive care from
 Community Providers.
 This patch implements functionality to make, cancel and mark as NO Show
 appointments for Community Care Referral appointments in non-count clinics
 at the Veteran's home Vista site. The appointment actions are completed in
 the HealthShare Referral Manager (HSRM) software by non-VA and VA care
 coordination staff. Appointment information for appointments made in the
 community is recorded in HSRM, and this data is then automatically pushed
 into Vista using HL7 Scheduling Information Unsolicited (SIU) messages.
 NOTE: THIS PATCH IS AN INTERACTIVE PATCH. THE PATCH INSTALLER IS
 REQUIRED TO ENTER/RESPOND TO PROMPTS DURING THE INSTALLATION.
 NOTE: This patch creates the  GMRC HSRM SIU HL7 MESSAGES VistA Mail
 Group. This mail group will send a VistA email message to the members of
 this group if there is a problem with filing the HSRM consult
 appointment due to not being able to match the consult title to a VistA
 clinic. This group should be populated after the patch install is
 completed. Members of this mail group should be VistA users that can
 resolve the issue with the clinic name and consult title.

Patch Subject:  ABNORMAL REPORT FORMATTING & DX CODE PROCESSING
Description:

 INC2890615
 INC6714227
 Associated NSR(s):

 Participating Test Sites:
 =========================
 White River Junction VAMC
 South Texas HCS (San Antonio)
 Problem A:
 ----------
 The Abnormal Exam Report [RA ABNORMAL] is formatted in a way that is
 sometimes misleading as to which diagnostic codes go with which exams.
 Resolution A:
 -------------
 Routine RAPRINT1 is modified to adjust the report formatting so that
 the diagnostic code header is clearly positioned above the exams it
 represents.
 Problem B:
 ----------
 A subscript error was reported when attempting to process a ""Procedure
 Changed"" alert [#67] in CPRS:
 <SUBSCRIPT>SET1+25^RAO7PC4
 The 'changed from' procedure is missing from the 'DATA FOR PROCESSING'
 field [#2] in the ALERT TRACKING [#8992.1] file.
 RESOLUTION B:
 -------------
 Routine RAO7PC4 is modified as follows:
 If the 'changed from' procedure is missing in the alert data, it will
 first try to get the procedure information from the order, if available,
 and if that fails it will display an 'UNKNOWN' on the alert when
 processed.
 PROBLEM C:
 ----------
 Radiology identifies the primary and secondary diagnostic codes (DX) based
 on the order they are received in the OBX segments of the report message
 (HL7 version 2.4 only). A primary designation on Powerscribe does not
 dictate the order that they are sent, but instead they are sorted by the
 DX code's number (highest to lowest).  So, a secondary code number of 1200
 (AAA Not Present) will be above the primary code of 1000 (no alert
 required) and therefore be filed as Primary in Radiology.
 RESOLUTION C:
 -------------
 Voice Recognition sends the Primary designation along with the DX code.
 VistA Radiology will check for that designation and assign the code as
 Primary regardless of its position in the HL7 message.  If no Primary
 designation is sent, the first code will still be identified as Primary.
 PROBLEM D:
 ----------
 The radiology registration menu enforces a location switch to the
 modality of the ordered procedure. There are times when it is necessary
 to register an exam under a different modality than what was ordered, as
 decided by the radiologist at the time of the procedure. Currently, the
 package prevents the modality from being changed and the order must be
 discontinued and reordered.
 RESOLUTION D:
 -------------
 A new security key (RA SWITCHLOC) is distributed with this patch. Holders
 of this key will be able to register an exam under a different modality
 than the ordered procedure when appropriate. Routine RAREG3 is modified to
 check for this security key at the time of exam registration.
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
 These are the documentation changes associated with this patch:

Patch Subject:  LAB PANEL DISPLAY, DATA NAME CORRUPTION, GROUP VERIFY PRINTING ISSUES
Description:

============
 The patch addresses three (3) issues:
 1. When a lab panel (cosmic) test is set up so the atomic tests in the
    panel split to separate accession areas (e.g.: one Chemistry and one
    Toxicology), results of the ordered panel test do not display all of
    the results of the atomic tests in the panel when viewed in CPRS from
    the Orders tab or from the Cover Sheet.
 2. Corruption can occur in the data dictionary - ^DD(63.04 - if one or
    more users are adding or editing data names for Laboratory tests.
 3. A VistA software error might be generated during execution of option
    ""Group verify (EA, EL, EW)"" if results are being printed.
 Blood Bank Review:
 ==================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*519 does not
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*519 does not
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical
 elements functions.
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*519 have no adverse effect on
 Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of
 installation of this patch.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. INC2298578 - Lab Panel Displays Incorrectly in CPRS
    Problem:
    --------
    When there are two (2) accessions created during the accessioning
    process, the date.time value used to store data about the tests in the
    LAB DATA file (#63) can be slightly different (e.g.: 6819595.864069 and
    6819595.86407). Only one (1) date.time value is stored in the ORDER
    file (#100).  Invariably, a $ORDER based on those parameters will
    exceed the end date (or be beyond the start date) after the first pass
    and then it will QUIT.  Consequently, only one (1) set of results will
    be returned.
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routines ^LR7OR1 and ^LR7OR2 are modified to search for results in
    the LAB DATA FILE (#63) for date.time entries that contain results for
    the proper order number.
    Routines: LR7OR1, LR7OR2
 2. INC4830471 - VistA Data Collision
    Problem:
    -------
    An issue might occur if two users are defining or modifying a
    Laboratory test data name at the same time using the VistA options ""Add
    a new data name"", ""Modify an existing data name"" or FileMan option
    ""MODIFY FILE ATTRIBUTES"". The issue is that two internal entry numbers
    (IENs) might be defined for identical data names. It is also possible
    that an IEN might have two name entries. However, this issue does not
    cause any harm because an IEN might have both a name and a synonym on
    file.
    Resolution:
    ----------
    (1) Modify options ""Add a new data name"" and ""Modify an existing data
        name"" so that an internal entry number (IEN) is locked which
        prevents more than one user from defining information for the same
        IEN at the same time.
    (2) Add a documentation update to the Laboratory Planning and
        Implementation Guide (PIG) that FileMan should not be used to add
        or edit data names since FileMan does not contain locking logic.
    (3) Add logic to the tasked option ""LRTASK NIGHTY"" (sic) to check for
        the ""one name / two IENs"" issue in case users continue to use
        FileMan for adding and editing.  Any instances of the issue found
        will be detailed in a MailMan message to users already specified
        for receipt of messages generated by the option ""LRTASK NIGHTY"".
    (4) Post-install routine LR519 will search for the ""one name / two
        IENs"" issue. A MailMan message will be sent to the LMI group with
        details of instances found. NOTE: This message is not delivered
        NEW. The LIM must actively look for the message in the IN basket.
        It is important to find and read this message.
    Routines: LRWU5, LRWU6, LRWU9, LRWU9A, LR519
    Documentation Updates
    ---------------------
    The Laboratory Planning and Implementation Guide (PIG) has been
    updated in the section titled: ""Add a new data name"".
    The Laboratory Technical Manual has been updated in the section titled:
    ""New Data Names"" and in the section titled ""Routine Descriptions"".
    Both manuals are located in the VA Document Library (VDL) at:
    https://www.domain.ext/vdl/application.asp?appid=71
 3. INC3357612 - Group Verify Printing Issue
    Problem:
    -------
    A ""READ"" error might occur during execution of the VistA option ""Group
    verify (EA, EL, EW)"" if an accession contains more than ten lines of
    comments to be processed.  The error is caused by a variable not being
    set which indicates the option has been queued to print results rather
    than displaying results to the user's screen.
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Add logic to the option ""Group verify (EA,EL, EW)"" which will determine
    whether results have been queued to a printer.

 1. INC4114897- Income Verification Match - IVM Mumps Error at Puget Sound
    Problem:
    ---------
    The DHCP OUTPUT LOGIC (#20) field of the IVM DEMOGRAPHIC UPLOAD FIELDS
    (#301.92) file does not show a value for the Temporary Address
    Zip (70), Temporary Address Country (71), or the Temporary Address
    County (72). It also has incorrect values for Temporary Address
    Province (73) and Temporary Address Postal Code (74).  This causes the
    temporary address to not display when uploading patient demographics.
    The values were previously added by post install routine DG53754P from
    patch DG*5.3*754.  Also, the TRANSFORM DHCP DATA (#.07) field of the
    IVM DEMOGRAPHIC UPLOAD FIELD (#301.92) file, for entries Temporary
    Address Country and Temporary Address County are currently set to
    0(zero), which does not allow the IVM Demographic data to be
    transformed from internal to external format.
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Post install routine IVM2P179 was created to update and add the correct
    strings for the corresponding entries. Additionally, it will update the
    TRANSFORM DHCP DATA (#.07) field of the IVM DEMOGRAPHIC UPLOAD FIELD
    (#301.92) file for the Temporary Address Country and Temporary Address
    County entries, to equal 1 so the IVM demographic data will be
    displayed correctly.

Patch Subject:  CAPRI XML DATA TYPES UPDATE
Description:

============
 Compensation and Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) currently operates on
 XML schema 1.0 when transmitting Disability Benefits Questionnaires
 (DBQ's). To comply with Information Exchange Packet Documentation
 standards for transmitting data and to maintain system and security
 standards, an update is required to the most current standards.
 These changes are for the following fields of data:
 -Facility Type
 -Service Provider Client Association Type
 -Exam Detail Type
 -Claim Information Type
 -Veteran of Interest Type
 -Document Type
 -Service Provider Type
 -Approver Type
 -Person Type
 -Client Type
 Patch DVBA*2.7*212 will also fix the following issues:
 -Other Facilities Visited button/message will be updated to display an
  appropriate message to users
 -Date Completed and Date Released do not get populated when exam
  templates are co-signed

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1) INC4579384 - bad message treatment facilities
    Problem:
    ---------
    The other facilities visited button/message was displaying a generic
    message that was not clear as to why switching to a site was rejected
    if it was a non-treatment facility.
    The previous message would inform the user to attempt manually
    switching sites using File->Switch Sites. This lead users down a wild
    goose chase as non-treatment facilities cannot be accessed this way
    either.
    Resolution:
    -----------
    CAPRI will be updated to display an appropriate message to users as to
    the reason they cannot access the site.
 2) INC5702037 - CAPRI - cannot cosign templates/exams
    Problem:
    --------
    Using the CPRS C&P Cosignature Transfer Utility option in CAPRI to
    cosign exams lead to errors caused from incorrect data being passed to
    VistA when it is updated/saved. Version control logic that was making a
    broker call overwrote the results needed to properly cosign an exam
    Resolution:
    -----------
    By moving the version control logic to the beginning of the procedure,
    we prevent the accidental override of data. This will allow users to
    cosign exams successfully utilizing the CPRS C&P Cosignature Transfer
    Utility option.
 3) INC5890511 - Enterprise Search not routing appropriately for
                 Fayetteville,NC
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the CAPRI Enterprise Search to find a veteran, if the
    veteran has a record in Fayetteville, NC when you select the site and
    click the ""Connect to Site"" button, CAPRI takes you to Fayetteville, AR
    instead.
    If you search for a Fayetteville, AR patient it will correctly take
    you to Fayetteville, AR.
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified the validation logic utilized when selecting a site to
    evaluate the entire site name, thus preventing CAPRI from connecting
    the user to the incorrect site (such as Fayetteville,AR instead of
    Fayetteville,NC). The user will now be routed to the correct
    destination.
 4) INC5523597 - ""Transmission to VLER Failed"" message not accurate in
                  some cases
    Problem:
    --------
    In CAPRI patch DVBA*2.7*209 a change was made when an exam failed to
    transmit it will attempt to re-transmit up to 5 times, after the fifth-
    re-attempt, a message is presented to the user ""Transmission to VLER
    failed.  Please contact the IT National Service Desk at
    1-855-673-4357.""
    Since the release of this patch multiple tickets have been submitted
    where CAPRI attempts to re-transmit 5 times, but indicates that all 5
    attempts failed.  However, in some cases the attempt was successful.
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modification was made to the logic used to determine if the re-attempt
    was successful.  This modification will accurately account for a
    transmission that may have been transmitted correctly within the 5
    re-attempts.
 5) RTC1118254 - IOC testing Defect Found at Tampa VAMC
    Problem
    -------
    Extra characters are being generated within the EDIPI field when
    running CAPRI Vista patch DVBA*2.7*212 V2 with CAPRI GUI
    DVBA*2.7*209.01(current production version)
    Resolution
    ----------
    Due to the possibility of C&P sites not installing both patches at the
    same time the team created a new RPC's for VistA that can pull the
    correct data field for patch 209 and 212.

   In order to back out this patch, sites must use the
   KIDS option to Backup a Transport Global after loading
   the patch. They can then restore the routines from the
   backup message. If this option is not used, then backing
   out is not possible.
   In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the
   decision to back-out the patch.
   It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines
   included in this patch prior to installation.
   The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
   No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no
   rollback strategy is required.
   To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum
   matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.

 1. OR*3*389 added a new utility to convert Unit Dose and IV Medication
 quick orders to Clinic Orders. 'Create Clinic Order QOs from Inpatient
 QOs' [OR CONV INPT QO TO CLIN ORD QO]. This utility also allows the
 user to delete a given quick order after a copy has been made. This same
 patch also restored the ability to delete a quick order from the
 'Enter/edit quick orders ' [ORCM QUICK ORDERS utility.]
 Both utilities use the same underlying logic for the delete
 operation. There was a flaw in this logic where the delete operation
 was not finding the orders placed using the selected order dialog.
 This has now been corrected. Jazz 356443
 2. An issue was discovered with consult/procedure auto-accept quick
 orders and Clinically Indicated Date (CID). If the CID is blank, and all
 other required fields are pre-populated, the quick order will be accepted
 by the system. This results in an order without a CID value. The consult
 and procedure order dialogs (GMRCOR CONSULT and GMRCOR REQUEST) have been
 updated to set the CID response as required. Additionally, coding logic
 for processing order dialogs has been modified to validate if the CID is
 valued or not and ensure the order dialog in CPRS will be displayed when
 necessary. Jazz 338586
 3. An issue was reported with the DSS DataBridge not being able to be
 notified appropriately when a nursing order was completed via CPRS. This
 patch addresses this problem by creating a new protocol: OR COMPLETE
 ORDER, which will be invoked whenever an order is marked complete. Any
 application or product that needs to be notified of complete orders may
 subscribe to this protocol. PSPO 2563 Jazz 328335
 4. A request was made, during testing of supply orders, that all supply
 orders, regardless of how they were entered, should display in the supply
 display group. In addition, an issue was reported with edits made to
 supply orders during finishing. When an edit occurred, the supply order
 would revert to the outpatient medication display group. This patch
 corrects both these issues by ensuring any dispense drug that is a supply
 drug, displays in the supply display group. Jazz 329491, 258326, and
 303788
 5. CPRS GUI v30b (OR*3.0*350) introduced a new security key, ORSUPPLY. The
 purpose of this key is to identify those non-provider users who are
 allowed to order supplies using the PSO SUPPLY order dialog. This patch,
 OR*3.0*397, will add the ORSUPPLY key to the list of security keys that
 may be assigned via the Allocate OE/RR Security Keys [ORCL KEY
 ALLOCATION]. Jazz 298588
 6. As part of the installation of patch OR*3*350 (CPRS v30b), all
 Outpatient Medication quick orders that were built for orderable items
 that were considered supply items were converted to the PSO SUPPLY dialog.
 However, because of issues that were found with the PSO SUPPLY dialog,
 patch OR*3*423 (CPRS v30c) reversed that, and moved them back to use the
 Outpatient Medication (PSO OERR) dialog. This patch corrects the PSO
 SUPPLY dialog issues. Therefore, a new option, CONVERT SUPPLY QUICK ORDERS
 [OR SUPPLY QO CONVERSION], is being added to the SUPPLY COVERSION UTILITY
 MENU [OR SUPPLY UTIL MENU]. When (if) a site wishes to move their supply
 quick orders back to the PSO SUPPLY dialog, this option can be used to
 accomplish that. Jazz 581005
 7. An issue was reported that a nurse without the ORSUPPLY key can enter
 and release a supply order if the encounter provider is someone other than
 themselves, and is authorized to write med orders. This patch adds checks
 when releasing a supply order to make sure the user releasing the order
 has the ORSUPPLY key or is authorized to write med orders. It also blocks
 the user from releasing the supply order as verbal or telephone. Jazz
 313956
 8. An issue was reported that a user with the ORES, PROVIDER, and
 ORSUPPLY keys (without authorization to write meds) was not able to place
 a supply quick order. This issue will be fixed with this patch. Jazz
 258733
 9. An issue was reported that supply orders were not able to be renewed.
 This will be fixed with this patch. Jazz 473803 SDM R11123709FY17
 10. An issue was found that a user without the ORSUPPLY key (and without
 authorization to write meds) was able to place a supply quick order that
 was set to auto accept. This will be fixed with this patch. Jazz 812936
 11. An issue was reported that Clinic Infusions quick orders do not get
 prompted to Auto Accept. This will be fixed with this patch. Jazz 413439
 12. An issue was found that the 'D' cross-reference on the ORDER file
 (#100) was not always getting set. This patch will fix that and will task
 off a job in the post-install to rebuild the 'D' cross-reference. Jazz
 356440
 13. Problem with statuses not being updated properly when a VBECS order
 was discontinued. SDM R13286486FY17
 14. An issue was reported that when renewing a supply Order in CPRS, the
 system was not allowing the user to change refills or pick-up. This will
 be fixed with this patch. Jazz 1013616
 15. An issue was found that when a supply order is entered via CPRS and
 changed in backdoor pharmacy, when the Order (#100) is updated, the DIALOG
 field changes from PSO SUPPLY to PSO OERR. This will be fixed with this
 patch. Jazz 1013631

 R11123709FY17 (Original)
 R13286486FY17
 1. R11123709FY17 - Supply order can not be renewed
 Problem:
 -------
 When trying to renew a supply order, the user receives an error: ""Unable
 to renew order"".
 Solution:
 --------
 Modified routine ORCACT01 to allow a supply order to be renewed.
 2. R13286486FY17 - VBECS order not discontinuing completely.
 Problem:
 --------
 Blood Bank order is being discontinued, but not updating status
 appropriately - order is Dc'd, but still says pending in CPRS and VBECS,
 but order is canceled in VistA. If you cancel the order in VBECS you can
 re-cancel the VistA order again - which updates CPRS as dc'd. The
 provider still thinks an order is pending, but we can't do anything with
 the order in VBECS/VistA.
 Solution:
 ---------
 Routine ORCSAVE was modified to appropriately discontinue all components
 of a multi-part blood bank order. (Jazz 529132)

meta-webos-backports,2,32,0,32,"autoconf: Add fix for sh verses bash issues

Libtool scripts were finding bash was /bin/sh and then using bashisms which
then got into sstate and used on machines where /bin/sh might be dash.

This changes things to search for bash first since its preferred. We then hardcode
bash into the scripts which is more correct.

This does mean we have a dependency on bash but many of our scripts have
that anyway.

Normally autofs mounts shares early in the boot process, whenever a file is requested. However, this automatic behavior doesn't work on FreeBSD NFS. Programs like Lirc will therefor fail when relying on configuration files stored (and symlinked) to a FreeBSD NFS shares.  This loop will check if the configuarion file consists of a symlink and then checks if the symlink can be resolved. In normal operation, this shouldn't cause troubles and all loops can be exited immediatly. When using a FreeBSD NFS share, these loops will make sure Lirc won't start before all configuartion files can be resolved. All with a timeout of 30 seconds in case of a network failure."

Update multisensor board to make sensing more robust"

New algorithm is:
- sample pulses for half a second at a time and count the first (up to) 20 pulses you see
that meet a minimum length and minimum delay criteria designed to ward off fake jitter pulses.
- find the median pulse interval of all the intervals you see.  Use the median so that the result
is insensitive to high outliers
- convert that median interval to a median pulse per second rate
- average the median rates from each sampling period and report that once per minute

The flow rate is sampled once per 16 seconds now in order to keep the power consumption (on/off ratio)
about the same as before, though a little higher. (.1/4 vs .5/16)

zeek-cryptomining,8,10,3,13,"Fix baseline for Zeek 4.0.0+ output

The change is related to https://github.com/zeek/zeek/pull/1160.  HTTP
DPD signatures no longer require matching both sides of a connection, so
the `json-rpc-request-http` signature which relies on
`http-request-body` is allowed to trigger on some connections where it
previously did not.  Ultimately, the test case shows that the
scripts/signature still catch the same miner and the same pool-servers,
but on earlier connections than before, which generally may still be ok
(but could mean more false positive detections of pool servers)."

qtgraphicaleffects,30,19,1,20,"Fix effects for dynamic source item updates

d53af701d166dac56c910319db9eac4b9aa4538d aimed to fix graphical
effects when the image source was cleared programmatically after
the shader effect had been initialized.

The fix made the assumption that the source size of the proxy
had been bound to the size of the input, but this turned out
to be wrong for many of the effects.

Further investigation revealed that the graphical effects were
never written to support source items with properties that
change. For instance, if you initialize the source image with
fill mode == Stretch, it would pick the direct throughput
mode and this would stick, even if you change the fill mode
later on, causing rendering errors.

Similarly, if you dynamically add children to a childless
source item at runtime, the effect would not be applied to
these items since the proxy render mode is required for that.

d53af701d166dac56c910319db9eac4b9aa4538d was only added to
5.15 because that is where the regression is visible, but
it turns out that this is a general problem in effects which
is also visible in Qt 6, both as rendering errors and also
as unpredictable performance implications, where the order
of operations can decide which mode of throughput you would
end up with.

The fix is to redo the polish whenever someone changes any
of the properties that might affect the choice of code path.

qtdoc,33,32,13,45,"Link up the information about categorized logging better

The use of logging categories in console.log was far too obscure
relative to its usefulness. Most reusable QML components and most
applications could make good use of it, routinely.

Likewise Debugging Techniques didn't mention categorized logging, only
the older macros.

Debugging Techniques now links to Debugging QML Applications and
vice-versa, and both of them link to the LoggingCategory QML object.

It's good to have more info in QT_MESSAGE_PATTERN. Since we stopped
pasting qFunc() all over, it's good to have %{function} (even though it
goes missing in release builds); and I think %{time process} is a great
way to see message timing.  %{type} and %{appname} make the output too
long for my taste, but my usual %if syntax for the type is too verbose
to put here; and %{appname} was already here for some reason.

QObject::dumpObjectTree() and friends.
